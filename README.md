# Project Name :
Cuisine Classification Using logistic regression and random forest classification algorithm.

# Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

# Steps:

1.Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2.Split the data into training and testing sets. Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) and train it on the training data.

3.Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on the testing data. Analyze the model's performance across different cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.
